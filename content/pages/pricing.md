        description: >
          Seamless, low-cost transactions with a fixed 0.1 STX service fee per
          transfer.

          Unlike percentage-based fees that scale with transaction size, our
          flat-rate model keeps costs predictable and fair, whether you're
          sending 10 STX or 10,000 STX.
        features:
          - 'Predictable Costs: No hidden charges'
          - >-
            Optimized for Microtransactions: Send any amount without worrying
            about scaling fees.
